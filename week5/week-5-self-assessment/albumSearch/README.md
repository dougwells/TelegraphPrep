# Getting Rid of Albums

Lucas is sifting through albums he's collected over the years and decides that he doesn't want any more Kanye West!

He'd like you to _.filter through his selection and return to him a new collection that has every album that doesn't have Kanye west as an ARTIST or as a featured artist.

We've imported the _.underscore library for you to use to solve this problem. The expected output is below.

* [ ] LucasChosenAlbums variable has every album in the original album array minus the ones that Kanye West is the main artist, or featured on.
