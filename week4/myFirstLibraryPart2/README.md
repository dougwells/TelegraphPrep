# MFL Part 2!

##Learning objectives:

Woot woot, Part 1 complete! 

By now you should be a bit more comfortable writing in functional programming style. 

Yesterday we spent our time building out a functional libary specifically for arrays. Today, we're going to spend time expanding our functionality to deal with arrays and objects. 

There's no reason they should miss out on the fun!
* [ ] expand loopThrough to functionality to be able to work on both objects and arrays
* [ ] containsValue
* [ ] expand your loopThrough functionality to be able to pass the value, index/key, and collection itself to its callback
* [ ] extendObject
* [ ] extendObjectNoDups
* [ ] indexOf 

EXTRA:
* [ ] pluckItem
* [ ] collectKeys
Nightmare mode:
