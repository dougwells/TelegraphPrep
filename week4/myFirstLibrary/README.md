# My First Library


## Learning Objectives:

You are now moving closer than ever to utilizing the power of functional programming. Today we're going to practice moving away from an imperative approach by having you build out your own library.

This library consists of the basic functionality that, as programmers, we use each and every day:

* [ ] loopThrough
* [ ] copyBy
* [ ] filterBy
* [ ] allPass
* [ ] somePass
* [ ] reduceNums


These functions are all things you've built before, however -- we're not going to use a for loop AT ALL to build the last five. We're going to build them using purely functional programming.

Keep these functions in mind, you will be using your library to build an even more complex library going forward.

Extra Credit:

* [ ] Anonymous Functions Refactor
* [ ] Expanded loopThrough
* [ ] Expanded reduceNums
