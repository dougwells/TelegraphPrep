### Define Higher Order Functions

* [ ] list the two cases in which a function can be called a higher order function
* [ ] create a higher order function and it's associated callback

		* [ ] You should have ample pseudocode
		* [ ] We will be grading on style so make sure your code is indented.

		####Note: 

You have probably noticed that there are no tests in your self assessment. This is done on purpose - we want you to assess your ability to test your own functions without tests built in.
