### Build Loop Through

* [ ] Build a loopthrough function that will loop through an array and invoke a callback on each element.
		* [ ] You should have ample pseudocode
		* [ ] We will be grading on style so make sure your code is indented.

####Note: 

You have probably noticed that there are no tests in your self assessment. This is done on purpose - we want you to assess your ability to test your own functions without tests built in.
