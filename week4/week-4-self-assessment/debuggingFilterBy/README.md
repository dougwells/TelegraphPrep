### Debugging FilterBy:

* [ ] Fix filterBy to work with given test case.
* [ ] Extra: allow filterBy to take objects or arrays.

* [ ] We will be grading on style so make sure your code is indented.

####Note: 

You have probably noticed that there are no tests in your self assessment. This is done on purpose - we want you to assess your ability to test your own functions without tests built in.
