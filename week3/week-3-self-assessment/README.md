# Prep+ Week 3 Self-Assessment

## Guidelines

- You should be able to finish this self assessment in about an hour.
- Self-assessments are meant to give you an idea of how well you understand--or can figure out--the material that you covered recently.

- What you see is what you get--most of the time we don't include outside libraries.
- TIP: Don't take too much time writing tests that are not required, instead use your Chrome Console for a quick and easy way to test your code.

## Self-Grading Process

After you complete each prompt, assign a grade to each item in the above Grading Outline, using this Grading Scale:

### Self-Assessment Grading Scale:

Qualitative grade | Meaning
---|---
Complete             | You believe your solution to be fully complete and meeting the specified requirements.
Mostly complete      | Your solution is well on its way to being complete, but you ran out of time or can't remember exactly how to do *one* particular aspect. You believe anyone who understands the problem well would endorse your solution as the right one, and know pretty clearly how to finish up any last touches.
Significant progress | You have the right idea and were heading in a good direction. Covers everything between Mostly Complete and Attempted.
Attempted            | You were very challenged by the prompt and had trouble making any significant progress on the problem, but wrote at least one meaningful line of code that appears to be a genuine attempt.
Not attempted        | Whether you've thought much about the problem or not, you have no lines of code to show for the problem. (Note, you should avoid ever getting into a situation where this is the grade you'd give yourself. Make a passing attempt at each problem before going back to complete any one problem.)


### Starting every problem

You are expected to at least start every problem. As with any test, you make the most progress in the first few moments of work on each question, and we don't want you losing out on credit you could collect just because you get fixated on one or two questions. Do an initial pass to get the easiest answers out of your system, then go back and improve anything you can.


## Submitting Solutions

**VERY IMPORTANT: Before submitting your solutions, find and fix all syntax errors**

Solutions are submitted via pushing your code to your OWN FORKED repository. We will take it from there.


## Problems

Each assessment contains folders that correspond to the prompts listed below. Complete the instructions in the file, `README.md` within each folder (reproduced below).
