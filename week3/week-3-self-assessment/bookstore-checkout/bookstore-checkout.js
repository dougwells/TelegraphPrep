/*

We accidentally left out one of the most important features of our Bookstore: the ability to buy books.

Create a function called checkOut that takes a balance and user as parameters and, if the balance is larger than the price of the books in the cart, prompts the user about whether they'd like to check out.

If the user does want to check out, subtract the total price of the book from the users balance and return their new balance. 

I've created a user and cart below to help you test your function:


var user = {
	'name': 'Bruno Mars',
	'balance', 29
};

var cart = [{'title': 'Lord of the Rings', price: 12}, {'title': 'Harry Potter', price: 15}];

*/


function checkout(cart, user){

};
