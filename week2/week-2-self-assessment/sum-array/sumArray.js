/*

sumArray should take an array of numbers and return the sum of each number.

example: 

var arr = [1, 9, 7, 15];

sumArray(arr) --> 32;


*EXTRA* build an 'add' function that takes two numbers as parameters and adds them together. Replace your add functionality inside of sumArray with your new 'add' function.
